The National Entrepreneurship Week is coming up. The British Council of Sri Lanka in partnership with the Ministry of Higher Education and University Grants Commission is organizing a series of events from 24th to 30th November 2008 to address 'Graduate Entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka'. It is really nice to see the interest on Entrepreneurship is growing up in the country. 






Thanks to [Maithree](http://maithree.blogspot.com/) for updating me on this. Please read the below article at British Council of Sri Lanka for more details.
