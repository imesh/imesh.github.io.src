If you are new to your Nikon camera there is a great place on the web to find out what your camera is capable of, [Nikon Digitutor](http://www.nikondigitutor.com/index_eng.html). It has a list of Nikon cameras available today and for each one there is a detail documentation including videos and animated graphics. This is a great concept, people can explore the features of their cameras by watching a nice video guide rather than searching it on a reference manual.
