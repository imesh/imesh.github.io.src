I just came across this web based desktop application called [Desktoptwo](https://www.desktoptwo.com). It is a free service which provides users a desktop on the web with web applications like Open Office, POP3 E-Mail Client, Web Site Editor, RSS Reader and IM Client. Seems like a great attempt but how ever you will need to have a flash, java enabled web browser to use this service.

The free service provides 1GB of hard disk space which is quite interesting. I think the web applications it provides will be very useful if you have not installed similar applications in your local desktop and needed such in an urgent situation or if your local user account has limited access.




Great work [Desktoptwo](https://www.desktoptwo.com). Keep up the good work!
