I accidentally deleted one of my NTFS partitions while deleting an EXT3 partition. What happened was I plugged my USB hard drive to my notebook and deleted an EXT3 partition from the Windows Disk Management. At that moment Windows was assigning drive letters to my potable hard disk. At the end I lost one of my NTFS partitions with the one I deleted.

One of my friends suggested me to use [On Track Easy Recovery Professional](http://www.ontrack.com/) to recover the data I lost. I'm not quite sure how it does that but I was able to recover almost everything I had in that partition (around 20GB). I think when we delete a partition from the Windows Disk Management it does not delete the content of the partition. Anyway thanks a lot On Track..!
