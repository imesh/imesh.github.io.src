Microsoft has started a donation campaign with related to Windows Live Messenger to donate world's most effective organizations dedicated to social causes like UNICEF. It works like this, people who uses Windows Live Messenger can add the i'm logo at the end of the messenger display name. Thereafter for each conversation they start Microsoft will share a portion of the program's advertising revenue with the effective organization.




Great work Microsoft! Keep up the good work!
