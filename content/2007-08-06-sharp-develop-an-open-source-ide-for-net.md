Sharp Develop is a FREE Open Source IDE for developing .NET Applications. This seems to be a great news for the .NET Application Developers. Sharp Develop supports C#, VB.NET and a new language called Boo (may be it's new to me :-)). The IDE looks very much similar to Visual Studio and most of the features in Visual Studio are there. This project has been started in year 2000 and the latest version available today is 2.2.

Sharp Develop supports to convert C# projects into VB.NET and wise versa using a Parser-based code converter which was not in Visual Studio. I tried that feature with Windows Applications but it did not work properly in converting a C# Windows Application into VB.NET. However I was able to convert Class Library Applications. I tested some of the projects I created in VS2005 in Sharp Develop and they worked perfectly without any problem. Sharp Develop uses MS Build just like in Visual Studio for building applications.




Class Designer is still not available in Sharp Develop (of course it is a considerably large component) but I heard that some one is developing a third party addin for that (great work!) in [Sharp Develop Community](http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/itaibh/archive/2007/02/08/class-diagram-status.aspx).




Sharp Develop comes with NDoc for generating Documentation, FX Cop for Code Analysis and with Integrated NUnit support. This seems to be a great tool for the future of .NET! Great work guys! :-) Keep up the good work!
