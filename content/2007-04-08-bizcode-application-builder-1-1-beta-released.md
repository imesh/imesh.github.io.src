Just released [BizCode Application Builder 1.1 (Beta)](http://www.bizcodeframework.net/cs/files/folders/application_builder/entry35.aspx). This is the second release of the BizCode Application Builder and the bug which did not show the command menu on the Visual Studio Tools menu in the earlier version was fixed. A new enumeration type was introduced to manage Database Management Systems in the framework and a new static method was added to the Database class to create Database instances from the application configuration settings. In the previous version this functionality was included inside the default constructor. Have a look at it and feel free to send your comments or any suggestions that you would like to make.
