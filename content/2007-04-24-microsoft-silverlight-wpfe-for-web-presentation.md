Microsoft has released a new technology called [Silverlight](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/asp.net/bb187358.aspx) (WPF/E) which is something similar to Macromedia Flash. As they say it supports most of the major web browsers like Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari (on Windows and Mac, Why not Linux if it supports Firefox?). I tried some of the samples on msdn and they seems to be working very fast on an average internet connection. Just like Macromedia Flash we need to pre install Silverlight to view web pages that uses it. Give it a try and see.
