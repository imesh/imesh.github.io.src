I just read an article written by [Hyrum W. Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_W._Smith) and it describes these wonderful Ten Natural Laws. I truly believe these are really natural laws, explicitly the last one.




1. You control your life by controlling your time.




2. Your governing values are the foundation of personal success and fulfillment.




3. When your daily activities reflect your governing values, you experience inner peace.




4. To reach any significant goal, you must leave your comfort zone.




5. Daily planning leverages time through increased focus.




6. Your behavior is a reflection of what you truly believe.




7. You satisfy needs when your beliefs are in line with reality.




8. Negative behaviors are overcome by changing incorrect beliefs.




9. Your self-esteem must ultimately come from within.




10. Give more, and you will have more.
