For someone who is passionate about TED having a local TED event in his or her area is facinating. I'm not sure whether this is the first TED event held in Sri Lanka, however for the time I was following TED this is the first. I couldn't attend the event by my self. Nevertheless I found most of the talks published on Youtube and TED very interesting. Following are some of them.
