It was a great day of GNU at the SLIIT Auditorium with Dr. [Richard M. Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman). According to the [ICTA](http://www.icta.lk) Dr. Stallman's visit to Sri Lanka has been arranged with late Professor [V. K. Samaranayake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._K._Samaranayake)'s invitation some time back. The conference was well organized with full of Free Open Source presentations and exhibits. Dr. Stallman made his speech on the topic of "Free Software in Ethics and in Practice" for more than two hours on the middle of the stage without any presentations. The speech was very interesting and I suppose that everyone enjoyed every second of it. A big thank to late Professor [V. K. Samaranayake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._K._Samaranayake) and everyone who made this event possible and a successful one.
