I just read an article adapted from the book "I Can't Accept Not Trying" written by [Michael Jordan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) and it was worth reading. Here are some of the quotes that I found really valuable.




<blockquote>

> 
> "I can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying." - Michael Jordan 
> 
> 

> 
> "When you understand the building blocks, you see how the entire operations works" - Michael Jordan
>

> 
> "I've always tried to lead by example." - Michael Jordan
