I found this wonderful article, _[An Interview with the Creator of Ruby](http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html)_ at [linuxdevcenter.com](http://linuxdevcenter.com/).This is the first time I heard about the creator of Ruby, [Yukihiro "matz" Matsumoto](http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/) who is a professional programmer who worked for a Japanese open source company. Writing a new language is not like writing a new application!!! I could not think of any thing similar to say that it would be like that because it would be harder job than that! Anyone who is familiar with a programming language could develop any kind of a software application but only hand full of people could develop better programming languages!

The thoughts of Matz is so great! he has finally developed what he really wanted, a scripting language that is more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. Great work Matz keep up the good work!
