Yesterday I found this new link, [Google TiSP](http://www.google.com/tisp/) on [Google](http://www.google.com/) which surprised me on the first sight. Google TiSP says that it is a free in-home wireless broadband service which connects to the internet through the municipal sewage lines. At the end of the day I only realized that it was April 1st :-). Just have a look at it may be you will find out what it really is!
