I registered at [twitter.com](http://www.twitter.com/) some time back after reading [Merill](http://www.merill.net/)'s blog post and today I came across it again and thought of having look at it. Twitter is a really nice service where you can post your current status (_"what you __are__ up to now"_) and the people who follow you will be updated with that information either using SMS or IM. 




Twitter has implemented it's privacy features really well, you can keep your updates limited to your followers and for your self and at any given time you can block your followers. Every time when someone attempts to follow you, you will be notified and will be asked to accept him/her. It seems to be really interesting!  





Updated 20/01/2008:




Just add twitter on your IM (may be Google Talk) and send the status to twitter. That's it! It simply post your status in your twitter page.
