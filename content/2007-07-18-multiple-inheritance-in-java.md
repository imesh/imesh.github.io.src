Java language does not support Multiple Inheritance, but there is a way to implement it using the Inner Class Concept.  





/* Class A Inherited by Class X */  
public class A extends X  
{  
public int a1;  
public int a2;  
  
public A()   
{  
}  
  
/* Class B Inherited by Class X, Y */  
public class B extends Y  
{  
public B()  
{   
  
}  
}   
}
