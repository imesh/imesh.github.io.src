Microsoft Research has done a great job on Surface Computing during the last four years and the result is [Microsoft Surface](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/). It is a new technology which allows users to interact with their digital content in a more different way. 

As I saw on the official web site it's a touch sensitive 30 inch screen which is mounted to a table, detects different objects once they are placed on. They have used a dot code (like bar code) pasted on the object for the identification. Once the object is placed on the table it provides various functionalities to interact with it. The most awesome feature I noticed is that it supports to transfer digital content from devices like digital cameras once they are placed on the table without any wired connection.
