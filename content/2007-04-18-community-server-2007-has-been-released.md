Telligent has released [Community Server 2007](http://get.communityserver.org/) which is the latest version of [Community Server](http://www.communityserver.org/) up to now. Community Server is a platform for publishing online communities with blogs, forums, photo sharing, file sharing, and with many more features. It has been developed on ASP.NET and it is available on both ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 2.0 versions. Even Community Server is a commercial product there is a free non-commercial version as well. In the free version there are only few limitations like limited reporting features and publishing Powered by Community Server image. I guess it is not a big problem for publishing any non-commercial community or a personal blog using Community Server unless you can have a separate SQL Server database per community in your web hosting account.

Talking about the latest version (2007) there are few new user friendly features that I really like. It has included a new theme system which supports to modify both community theme and the blog themes online without modifying any css files. Furthermore the theme settings can be imported/exported using an xml file. Great work [Telligent](http://telligent.com/)! Keep it up!
