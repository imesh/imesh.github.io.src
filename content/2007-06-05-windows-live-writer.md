Just downloaded [Windows Live Writer Beta](http://writer.live.com/) and this is the first test post. Seems like a good tool, it supports most of the popular blog services like Windows Live Spaces, Wordpress, Blogspot, Dasblog and Community Server. The only security issue I noticed is you have to provide your username and the password of the blog to the Live Writer, of course otherwise Live Writer will not be able to communicate with the blog :-)
