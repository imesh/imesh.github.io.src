[MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/) is a FREE GNOME Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C# and other .NET languages. I just installed MonoDevelop on Ubuntu 6.1 and it works fine. Unlike in Visual Studio MonoDevelop does not use System.Windows.Forms library instead it uses GTK#. Therefore we cannot simply compile and run a Windows Application developed in Visual Studio in MonoDevelop. We may either have to re-write the GUI source code or we may have to convert it to suit MonoDevelop using an automated tool, but still I could not find one.




Anyway MonoDevelop provides a comprehensive C# development environment on the Linux platform. Just like in Microsoft Visual Studio it has a GUI designing tool, intelligent code completion features, class management, built-in help, project support and a powerful add-in engine. I think this is great tool for C# developers who prefer to work on a Linux environment and I really like it! Great work mono-project team! keep up the good work!
