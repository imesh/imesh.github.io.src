Java Micro Edition (ME) is the Java Specification defined by Sun Microsystems for mobile and embedded devices with limited memory, display and power capacity. Sun only provides a reference implementation for Java ME, therefore third party vendors have implemented Java Runtime Environments (JRE) for different types of devices. I could not find the exact reason for this, but at the early statges of Java ME there had been a JRE release called Personal Java.
