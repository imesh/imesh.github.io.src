Today I came through this awesome JavaScript library [Lightbox2](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2) which is a simple, unobtrusive script used to overlay images on the current page. It is a free product!! All the credit goes to [Lokesh Dhakar](http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/about/)!!

[Justin Barkhuff](http://www.justinbarkhuff.com/) has improved Lightbox2 further and he has come up with [Lightbox Slideshow](http://www.justinbarkhuff.com/lab/lightbox_slideshow) which is another great piece of work!! Thanks guys!! It is a really useful for publishing images on the web. Click on an image in my [photography](http://rootfolder.info/photography) page to see how it works. Lightbox Slideshow supports to group set of images together and navigate between them. Furthermore it allows adding Google Analytics to track image views. There are lot more configuration options available to customize it. Give it a try!
